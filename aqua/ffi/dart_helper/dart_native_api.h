/**
 * A Dart_CObject is used for representing Dart objects as native C
 * data outside the Dart heap. These objects are totally detached from
 * the Dart heap. Only a subset of the Dart objects have a
 * representation as a Dart_CObject.
 *
 * The string encoding in the 'value.as_string' is UTF-8.
 *
 * All the different types from dart:typed_data are exposed as type
 * kTypedData. The specific type from dart:typed_data is in the type
 * field of the as_typed_data structure. The length in the
 * as_typed_data structure is always in bytes.
 *
 * The data for kTypedData is copied on message send and ownership remains with
 * the caller. The ownership of data for kExternalTyped is passed to the VM on
 * message send and returned when the VM invokes the
 * Dart_HandleFinalizer callback; a non-NULL callback must be provided.
